# HTTP History

The HTTP History feature allows you to view requests and responses as they pass through the proxy. The HTTP History page shows a table of all requests that have been proxied through Caido, along with details such as the request method, host, path, status code and length.

## Filtering

The HTTP History page provides several ways to filter and Scope the requests displayed.
These filters and scoping options can be useful to focus on specific requests or to exclude certain requests from the list.

You can filter requests by:

- File Extension
- Method
- Port
- Path
- Status Code
- ...
