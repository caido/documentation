# Creating Your First Project

## What are Projects?

---

Think of **Projects** as separate directories for your audits. Projects allow you to stay organized when testing against multiple targets within the same Caido instance.

## Creating a New Project

---

1. Select the `Workspace` tab from the left-hand menu within the Caido window.
2. Ensure the `Projects` tab in the top-left area of the Caido window is selected.
3. Click on the red `+ Create a project` button in the top-right area of the Caido window.
4. Name the Project - consider using a descriptive name of the context the project will be utilized for (_such as the name of the client you are auditing, a specific bug bounty program, the name of the product, etc._)
5. Once you have entered a name - click on the `Create` button.
6. Your new Project will now appear in the `Workspace` panel.

## Switching Between Projects

---

Caido offers the ability to switch between your Projects with ease. Switching Projects can be accomplished in two different ways:

1. Selecting the `Workspace` tab from the left-hand menu within the Caido window and clicking the `Select` button next to the desired Project.
2. Selecting the desired Project in the drop-down menu, located in the upper-right corner of the Caido window.
