# Sitemap

The `Sitemap` tab allows you to visualize the structure of any website that is proxied through Caido.

It keeps track of domains, folders, and requests, as well as any variations in query parameters and POST bodies. The Sitemap page provides a clear, hierarchical view of the website's structure, making it easy to identify and explore different parts of the site.

The Sitemap displays a tree-like structure, with the root node representing the root domain of the website. Each branch of the tree represents a subdomain or subfolder, and the leaves of the tree represent individual requests. You can click on any node to expand or collapse it, revealing or hiding its child nodes.

## Sitemap Layout

To familiarize yourself with the Sitemap interface, continue below:

1. Select the `Workspace` tab from the left-hand menu within the Caido window.
2. This pane presents the domains that have been proxied through Caido. Toggling the `>` icon to `âˆ¨` will expand the associated domain/folder, revealing its contents. You can search for a specific domain/subdomain by utilizing the `Search domain...` bar.
3. Upon selecting a node of the tree-like structure within the previously mentioned pane - all associated requests are displayed in this pane. Clicking the column names (_located at the top and spanning horizontally_) within this pane will sort the requests by the selected column category.
4. The request and paired response panes are available here. At the bottom-right corner of the response pane, the response size (in bytes) and how long the response took to receive (in milliseconds) is provided.
5. Clicking the cog wheel icon will present a dropdown menu that lists the aforementioned column categories. Select/deselect to include/exclude them respectively.
