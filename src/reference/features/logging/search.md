# Search

The `Search` tab provides a comprehensive view of all the requests that have been generated by tools, such as the Replay and Automate features, in addition to requests that are proxied through Caido via Intercept.

It differs from HTTP History in that way - as the HTTP History tab does not list any request generated by Automate and Replay.

This extra inclusion allows you to sort through the results of all your testing using other Caido features in a single location.

## Filtering

> **PRO FEATURE**

Additional default Filter Presets in the `Advanced options` panel are included to display/exclude traffic generated by Replay and Automate.

View the [Filters](../overview/filters.md) documentation for more information.

::: tip

- Clicking the column names (_located at the top and spanning horizontally_) within the top request list pane will sort the requests by the selected column category. View the [Sorting by Properties](../overview/sorting.md) documentation for more information.
