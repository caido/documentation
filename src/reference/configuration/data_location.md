# Data Location

All the data Caido creates is stored in a single folder. The default location of this folder is dependent on your OS:

| OS      | Location                                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Linux   | `~/.local/share/caido`                           |
| MacOS   | `~/Library/Application\ Support/io.caido.Caido/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\caido\Caido\data`                     |

::: info
Currently, it is **not possible** to create Caido Projects outside this folder. However, you can change the location of the whole folder if needed.
:::

::: warning
Make sure to copy your existing data to the new location before restarting your Instance.
Otherwise it will restart as if you were on a new device.
