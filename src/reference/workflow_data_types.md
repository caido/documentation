# Workflow Node Data Types

Nodes are defined by various different input and output data types.

When referencing a node's data for use in another, the types must be compatible with each other.

## Data Type Conversions

Data can be shared across nodes as long as the types are `Exact` (expected) or are `Compatible` based on the following conversions:

::: tip
You can view the data type by clicking on a node and viewing the value within the parenthesis. This will be above the reference data drop-down menu.

### String

Strings are compatible with:

- **String**
  - **Choice**: Variation of string.
  - **Code**: Variation of string.
- **Bytes**: Encoded as UTF-8 with lossy conversion (invalid characters are replaced with `ï¿½`).
- **Bool**: Converts to `"true"` or `"false"`.
- **Integer**: Base-10 decimal encoding.

### Bytes

Bytes are compatible with:

- **String**: Bytes as UTF-8 encoded.
- **Bool**: Converts to `"true"` or `"false"` in bytes.
- **Integer**: First converts to string type and then to  bytes UTF-8 encoded.

### Bool

Booleans are compatible with:

- **Integer**: Is `true` if integer is not zero - otherwise `false`.
- **Bytes/String**: Is `true` for "true", "on", "yes", and "1" - otherwise `false`.

### Integer

Integers are compatible with:

- **Bool**: Is `true` if integer is `1` - `false` if `0`.
- **Bytes**: Converted to string loosely, supports hex (0x), binary (0b), octal (0o), supports sign (+, -).
- **String**: Parsed from string, supports hex (0x), binary (0b), octal (0o), supports sign (+, -).

### Request & Responses

There is no conversion besides their own.
