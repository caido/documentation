# Instances

An "instance" is a reference to the directory that stores the data generated by Caido's installation and usage. The default [data storage location](/reference/data_storage.md) on the file system of your device is dependent on the operating system.

This abstraction allows you to manage multiple, separate installations of Caido on one device.

As Caido is built around a client/server architecture, each instance is granted a set of OAuth credentials by our cloud service for [authentication](/concepts/authentication.md) between the client (_desktop or web application GUI_) to the server (_Caido CLI_).

## Desktop Application

The default installation includes a `Local instance` that runs the Caido CLI server locally and stores data in the directory specific to your operating system.

By clicking on the `+ New instance` button, you can create additional local instances that utilize a different listening address/port and data directory.

You can also add remote instances to connect to external installations of the Caido CLI.

## Dashboard

Instances can be managed from your account dashboard.

To manage your instances, you can head over to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.caido.io/instances).

::: warning NOTE
If you delete an instance and try to login again, you will see the error ["Login URL generation failed"](http://localhost:3000/common_errors.html#login-url-generation-failed). You will need to reset the credentials.
