# HTTPQL

HTTPQL is the query language we use in Caido to let you filtering requests and responses. It is an evolving language that we hope will eventually become an industry standard.

# Primitives

<img width="500" alt="Parts of a filter clause" src="/_images/httpql_clause.png" no-shadow center/>

## 1. Namespace

The first part of a filter clause is the `namespace`. We currently support 3 namespaces:

- **req**: For HTTP requests
- **resp**: For HTTP responses
- **preset**: For filter presets

The **preset** namespace is a bit different, it doesn't have a `field` nor an `operator`. See the [filters](/features/overview/filters.md) page to learn more about filter presets.

## 2. Field

The second part of filter clause is the `field`. Fields differ based on the the `namespace`.
We will add more fields eventually. [Let us know](https://github.com/caido/caido/issues/new?template=feature.md&title=New%20HttpQL%20field:) which ones you need!

### req

- **ext**: File extension (if we detected one). Extensions in Caido always contain the leading `.` (like `.js`). We are liberal in what we accept as an extension.
- **host**: Hostname of the target server.
- **method**: HTTP Method used for the request in uppercase. If the request is malformed, this will contain the bytes read until the first space.
- **path**: Path of the query, including the extension.
- **port**: Port of the target server.
- **raw**: The full raw data of the request. This allows you to search on things we currently don't index (like headers).

### resp

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD038 -->

- **code**: Status code of the reponse. If the response is malformed, this will contain everything after `HTTP/1.1 ` and the following space.
- **raw**: The full raw data of the response. This allows you to search on things we currently don't index (like headers).

## 3. Operator

We have two categories of operators depending on the data type.

### Integers

That category of operators work on field that are numbers like `code` and `port`.

- **eq**: Equal to `value`
- **gt**: Greater than `value`
- **gte**: Greater than or equal to `value`
- **lt**: Less than `value`
- **lte**: Less than or equal to `value`
- **ne**: No equal to `value`

### String/Bytes

That category of operators work on field that are text (or bytes) like `path` and `raw`.

- **cont**: Contains `value` (case insensitive)
- **eq**: Equal to `value`
- **like**: Sqlite `LIKE` [operator](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html#the_like_glob_regexp_match_and_extract_operators). The symbol `%` matches zero or more characters (like `%.js` to match `.map.js`) and the symbol `_` matches one character (like `v_lue` to match `vAlue`).
- **ncont**: Doesn't contain `value` (case insensitive)
- **ne**: No equal to `value`
- **nlike**: SQLITE `NOT LIKE` operator, see `like` for more details.

We don't currently support full regex, but we will in the future.

## 4. Value

This is the value against which the field will be compared. The value is either an integer or a string depending on the field.

### Preset

The `preset` value is a different. You can reference presets in one of two ways:

- **Name**: `preset:"Preset name"`
- **Alias**: `preset:preset-alias`

Head over to the [filters](/features/overview/filters.md) page to learn more about filter presets.

### Standalone

We support string standalone values **without** `namespace`, `field` and `operator` (like `"my value"`).
It is a shortcut to search across both requests and responses, it is replaced at runtime by:

```
(req.raw.cont:"my value" OR resp.raw.cont:"my value")
```

# Query

<img width="600" alt="A full HTTPQL Query" src="/_images/httpql_logical.png" no-shadow center/>

Queries are composed of multiple filter clauses that are combined together using `logical operators` and `logical grouping`.

## Logical operators

We offer two logical operators:

- **AND**: Both the left and right clauses must be true
- **OR**: Either the left or right clause must be true

Operators can be written in upper or lower case. Both have the **same priority**.

## Logical grouping

We don't have priority of operations, this means that the automatic grouping is done from **left to right** (this might change eventually):

- `clause1 AND clause2 OR clause3` is equivalent to `((clause1 AND clause2) OR clause3)`
- `clause1 OR clause2 AND clause3` is equivalent to `((clause1 OR clause2) AND clause3)`
- `clause1 AND clause2 AND clause3` is equivalent to `((clause1 AND clause2) AND clause3)`

We thus recommend that you insert parentheses to make sure the logicial groups represent what you are trying to accomplish.
