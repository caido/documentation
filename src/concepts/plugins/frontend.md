# Frontend Plugins

The frontend client component of Caido is the application running on your device. Frontend Plugins are designed to enhance the user interface.

With frontend Plugins you can:

- Enhance the user interface/experience.
- Add new pages, components and elements.
- Modify the appearance, behavior and functionality of the user interface.
- Provide additional features and customization options.

These Plugins are responsible for handing user interactions, rendering data and communicating with the backend server via Caido's API.
