## Arch User Repository

::: danger
 Using an unofficial repository to install Caido may expose you to potential security risks. The installation is managed by third-party maintainers, not the official Caido team, which means it may not be as regularly updated or audited.
:::

1. To download the Caido desktop application for Arch Linux and Arch-based distributions, first ensure you have the required dependencies installed.

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel fuse2
```

2. Then, clone the package from the repository.

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/caido-desktop.git
```

```bash
cd caido-desktop
```

4. Next, check for and install any missing dependencies, build the package from the source code, and install it with the `makepkg` tool.

```bash
makepkg -si
```

5. Ensure the package is executable with `chmod +x`.

```bash
chmod +x caido-desktop-vX.XX.X-linux-<architecture>.AppImage
```

6. Rename the package to `caido` for convenience.

```bash
mv caido-desktop-vX.XX.X-linux-<architecture>.AppImage caido
```
