# Creating Your First Project

## What are Projects?

_For advanced documentation on this topic, view the [Projects](/guides/projects.md) guide._

Caido utilizes a client-server architecture model. An [Instance](/concepts/essentials/instances.md) of Caido is essentially an installation.

Think of `Projects` as separate directories for your audits. Projects allow you to stay organized when testing against multiple targets within the same Caido instance.

## Creating a New Project

1. Select the `Workspace` tab from the left-hand menu within the Caido window.
2. Ensure the `Projects` tab in the top-left area of the Caido window is selected.
3. Click on the red `+ Create a project` button in the top-right area of the Caido window. Name the Project - consider using a descriptive name of the context the Project will be utilized for (_such as the name of the client you are auditing, a specific bug bounty program, the name of the product, etc._). Once you have entered a name - click on the `Create` button.
4. Your new Project will now appear in the `Workspace` panel.
5. Clicking on `â‹®` will present the following additional options:

- **Rename**: Rename your Project.
- **Copy path**: Copy the Project's data location on your device to your clipboard.
- **Create backup (Caido Pro Feature)**: Create a Backup of the Project data.
- **Delete**: Delete the Project from your Instance.

## Switching Between Projects

Caido offers the ability to switch between your Projects with ease. Switching Projects can be accomplished in two different ways:

1. Selecting the `Workspace` tab from the left-hand menu within the Caido window and clicking the `Select` button next to the desired Project.
2. Selecting the desired Project in the drop-down menu, located in the upper-right corner of the Caido window.
