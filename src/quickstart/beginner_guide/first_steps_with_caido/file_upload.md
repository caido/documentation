# Uploading Files for Use in Automate

_For advanced documentation on this topic, view the [Files](/guides/files.md) guide._

`Automate` allows you to brute-force/fuzz designated elements of a request.

- In order to utilize the [Hosted File Payload Type](/guides/automate.md#payload-types) in `Automate` - you must first upload payload files/wordlists in the `Files` interface within Caido.
