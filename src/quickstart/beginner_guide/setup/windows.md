5. Once authenticated, name and allow access to your Caido [Instance](/concepts/essentials/instances.md).

::: info
The Instance requires access to your account username, email address, and subscription. By default, `Enable the AI assistant feature` (_[for Individual & Team subscriptions](https://caido.io/pricing)_) and `Stay logged-in for an extended period` will be selected. You can deselect these checkboxes if you do not want these features enabled.
