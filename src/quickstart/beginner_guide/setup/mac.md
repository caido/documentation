## Disk Image (.dmg)

A `.dmg` file is a macOS disk image used to distribute applications. It's the most common and user-friendly way to install apps on Mac.

1. To download the Caido desktop application on your macOS device, visit [caido.io/download](https://caido.io/download) or check out the latest releases page on [Github](https://github.com/caido/caido/releases/latest).

## Homebrew (Unofficial)

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a popular package manager that simplifies the installation and management of software. It allows users to easily install, update, and manage software packages from the command line.

::: danger
 Using an unofficial Homebrew tap to install Caido may expose you to potential security risks. The installation is managed by third-party maintainers, not the official Caido team, which means it may not be as regularly updated or audited.
:::

::: tip
To download and install Homebrew, use the following terminal command:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once installed, Homebrew can be used globally by adding it to your PATH environment variable:

```
echo >> /Users/<username>/.zprofile
```

```
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/<username>/.zprofile
```

```
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

1. To download and install the Caido desktop application on your macOS device, run the following terminal command:

## Shared Steps

After Caido has been installed using either method:

1. Open the `Applications` folder, launch Caido, and select `Open` when met with the security window.

2. With Caido launched, click the `Start` button and log in with your credentials or create an account.

3. Once authenticated, name and allow access to your Caido [Instance](/concepts/essentials/instances.md).

::: info
The Instance requires access to your account username, email address, and subscription. By default, `Enable the AI assistant feature` (_[for Individual & Team subscriptions](https://caido.io/pricing)_) and `Stay logged-in for an extended period` will be selected. You can deselect these checkboxes if you do not want these features enabled.

4. Once authorized, return to Caido and navigate through the brief tutorial on creating a new [Project](/guides/projects.md) and how to download and import [Caido's CA Certificate](/guides/import_ca_certificate.md) to your browser.
