# Welcome to Caido!

## What is Caido?

Caido is a lightweight web security auditing toolkit, built _by hackers for hackers_.

Normally, users interact with web applications in a manner intentionally designed by developers. Web applications expect certain requests and will reply with programmatically predetermined responses.

With Caido, you gain the unexpected ability to view, intercept, and modify the bidirectional communication between your browser and servers hosting web applications.

It is through this subversion of expectations that you can find weaknesses in systems.

## Who is Caido for?

**Anyone.** With its intiutive design, Caido makes web application hacking accessible to beginners. While its comprehensive set of features and extensibility equip experienced security professionals with the tools they need to streamline their workflows.
