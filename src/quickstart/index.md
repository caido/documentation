## I am just starting!

Great! Glad to have you on board! ðŸš€

We suggest you start with the [Beginner's Guide](./beginner_guide/welcome_to_caido/onboarding.md) and [Tutorials](./showcase) to get familiar with the basics.

If you are facing an issue, look into [Common Errors](/reference/common_errors), it might have a clue. Otherwise feel free to join our [Discord](https://links.caido.io/www-discord) and ask for help! ðŸ˜Š

## I know my way around!

You might want to dig into more advanced features we offer like [HTTPQL](/concepts/essentials/httpql.md) and running Caido on remote [VPS](/guides/user_guide/vps.md).
