# Enabling/Disabling Plugins

Caido plugin packages consist of a backend component, frontend component, or both and each component can be enabled/disabled independently.

To enable/disable a plugin component, navigate to the `Installed` tab within the Plugins interface, **click** on the <code><Icon icon="fas fa-chevron-right" /></code> button of a plugin row, and **click** on either the backend or frontend checkbox to toggle its fill.
