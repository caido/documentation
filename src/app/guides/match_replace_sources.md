# Selecting a Traffic Source

The options available under the Sources section of the Match & Replace interface determine the traffic the rules will apply to.

::: tip
To target specific requests/responses, add [HTTPQL query statements](/app/guides/filters_httpql.md) in the `Condition` input field.
:::

- To apply a rule to all proxied requests/responses, **click** on the `Intercept` checkbox.

- To apply a rule to all requests generated by Automate sessions, **click** on the `Automate` checkbox.
