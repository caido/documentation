# Instances & Authentication

An "instance" is a reference to the directory that stores the data generated by Caido's installation and usage.

This abstraction allows you to manage multiple, separate installations of Caido on a single device.

## Local Instances

Additional local instances can be created using either the standalone Caido CLI or desktop application by [changing the data storage location](/app/guides/data_location.md).

## Remote Instances

Additional instances can also be created for remote installations of the Caido CLI via the launch window of the desktop application.

## Authentication

Each instance requires access control to authenticate the Caido GUI (_client component_) to the Caido CLI (_server component_), to ensure it is only accessible to you.

::: danger
Although the API is authenticated, the proxy traffic is currently unprotected. We **strongly** advise not to expose your Caido instances to the open internet.

Authentication in Caido is based on [OAuth 2.0](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749). Every instance that is created [registers](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7591.html) to our cloud service and obtains a client ID and secret. On initial login to the instance using your account credentials, you claim the instance's client ID.

### OAuth Grants Used by Caido

- <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-1.3.4" target="_blank">Client Credentials</a>: This grant is used to obtain an access token that authenticates the instance with the cloud.
- <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8628.html" target="_blank">Device Authorization</a>: This grant is used to obtain access and refresh tokens to authenticate users. Contrary to most other grants, this grant eliminates the browser redirect.
- [Refresh Token](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-1.5): This grant is used to refresh user access tokens without requiring re-authentication.

::: warning NOTE
At this moment, we do not make any guarantees on the lifetime of the tokens.

### Secrets Storage

- The **client secret** and **instance access token** are both encrypted and stored in the `secrets.db` database in the instance data directory on disk.
- **User access and refresh tokens** are stored in the client's `local storage`. These tokens are never stored on the instance, but can be present in memory.
