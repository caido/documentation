## Log Files

As Caido utilizes a [client/server architecture](/concepts/essentials/instances.md), both frontend and backend logs are produced.

::: danger
As log files can contain sensitive information, only send them in private conversations with a verified member of the Caido team. If you are contacting us on Discord, we will open a private channel before asking for logs.

### Backend Logs

To obtain the backend log files of your instance, navigate to the `/logs` subdirectory of the data storage directory. The default location of this directory is dependent on your operating system:

| OS      | Location                                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Linux   | `~/.local/share/caido`                           |
| MacOS   | `~/Library/Application\ Support/io.caido.Caido/` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\caido\Caido\data`                     |

### Frontend Logs

To obtain the frontend logs, either:

- Access the DevTools interface by pressing the `F12` key, using the keybinding `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `I`, or selecting `Inspect` from the **right-click** context menu. Within the `Console` **right-click** and select `Save as...`/`Save all Messages to File`/etc. to export the messages as a `.log` file.

- Or, **click** on the <code><Icon icon="fas fa-file-lines" /> Logs</code> button at the bottom of the Caido user-interface, record your activity, and then **click** on the <code><Icon icon="fas fa-download" /></code> button to export the messages as a `.log` file.

To reproduce the bug, follow these steps:

1. In the `Intercept` interface, click on the `Response` button.
2. Begin intercepting responses, by **clicking** on the <code><Icon icon="fas fa-angles-right" /> Forwarding</code> button to toggle it to <code><Icon icon="fas fa-pause" /> Queuing</code>.
3. In a terminal, execute `curl -x 127.0.0.1:8080 https://example.com`.
4. Modify status code of the intercepted response.
