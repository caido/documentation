# Reporting a Bug

Found a bug in Caido or need help debugging? You are at the right place!

To help us resolve the issue quickly, please provide the necessary details to reproduce the bug.

## Retrieve Logs

### Backend Logs

Caido is using a [client/server architecture](/concepts/essentials/instances.md), that means that we need logs from two places.

The first place to look for logs is in your [data folder](/reference/internal_files.md), you should see a `logs` folder.

### Frontend Logs

The second place to look for logs is in your browser's console included in your [browser developer tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools).

You can open the console by pressing `F12` or right-clicking within the browser and selecting `Inspect Element`.
