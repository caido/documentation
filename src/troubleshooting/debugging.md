# Debugging

To assist with troubleshooting, Caido can be configured to include debug entries in the generated log files.

## Caido CLI

To enable the inclusion of debug entries in the log files with the Caido CLI, launch Caido with the `--debug` argument.

```
caido --debug
```

## Desktop Application

To enable the inclusion of debug entries in the log files within the Caido desktop application, in the launch window, **click** on the <code><Icon icon="fas fa-ellipsis-vertical" /></code> button attached to an instance and select `Edit`.
