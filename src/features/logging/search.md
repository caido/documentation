# Search

The Search feature provides a comprehensive view of all the requests that have been generated by tools, such as the automate and replay features, in addition to requests that are proxied through Caido. The Search page is similar to the [HTTP History](/features/proxy/intercept.md) page, with the same layout, filtering and scoping options.

## Filtering

In addition to all the filter options available in HTTP History, you can also filter by source tool (Replay, HTTP History, Automate).
