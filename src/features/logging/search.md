# Search

The Search feature provides a comprehensive view of all the requests that have been generated by tools, such as the automate and replay features, in addition to requests that are proxied through Caido. The Search page is similar to the [HTTP History](/features/proxy/intercept.md) page, with the same layout and scoping options. The filtering is using our new query language [HttpQL](/internals/httpql.md).
