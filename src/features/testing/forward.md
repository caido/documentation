# Forward

The Forward page allows you to control the flow of requests through the proxy by pausing and resuming forwarding. When forwarding is paused, requests that go through the proxy are temporarily stored in the Forward table, where you can review, edit, or drop them before forwarding them.

## Pausing and Resuming Forwarding

To pause forwarding, toggle the "Forwarding" button on the top right of any page. This will prevent any new requests from being forwarded through the proxy and will queue them up in the Forward table.

For each request in the Forward table, you can then choose to edit its contents, as well as forward or drop it.

When you're done forwarding, toggle the "Queuing" button to resume forwarding. This will forward all the queued up requests in the Forward table.
