# Backups

You can create backups of your projects at anytime inside Caido.
They are self-contained files that can be easily shared with colleagues, partners, clients, etc.
Creating backups is a `Pro` feature, but **all** plans can restore backups.

## Create

> **PRO FEATURE**

You create backups directly from the `Projects` tab of your `Workspace` in the 3-dots menu.
It is possible to backup any project including the currently selected one.

Once the backup is done, it will be available in the `Backups` tab. If your instance is remote, you can `Download` the backup to your local machine. Otherwise, you can click on the 3-dots menu to get the path on disk if you wish to copy it directly.

## Restore

Restoring a backup is usually done via the `Import` button in the `Projects` tab.
You will need to upload a backup file to the instance to perform the restore.
Restoring always creates a new project, that is why you also need to enter a unique name.
