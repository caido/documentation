# Projects

The Projects tab allows you to organize your work by creating different projects for different tasks or assessments. A project in Caido acts as a container for all the information related to a particular assessment, such as requests, filters, scope presets and tamper rules.

We encourage you to keep your work organized by creating many smaller projects.

The Project button on the top right of any page enables you to easily switch between your projects. **No restart is needed to do so.** You can navigate different assessments quickly without losing track of the information you've collected.

By clicking on the dots in the Actions section, you can Rename your projects and Copy the path.

> Projects are automatically upgraded when you use them with a newer Caido version and **CANNOT** be downgraded

To create backups or restore your projects, see the [Backups](/features/workspace/backups.md) page for more details.
