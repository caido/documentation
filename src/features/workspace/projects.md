# Projects

The Projects page allows you to organize your work by creating different projects for different tasks or assessments. A project in Caido acts as a container for all the information related to a particular assessment, such as requests, filters, scope presets and tamper rules.

This allows you to easily switch between different assessments without losing track of the information you've collected and keep your work organized.
