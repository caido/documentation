Registration Keys allow you to automatically claim new instances. This allows you to deploy instances safely without human intervention. For example, ahead of an engagement or on demand in CICD.

Registration Keys are easy identifiable with the `ckey_` prefix. They can be single use or reusable, a single use key is automatically revoked on use.

- Check our documentation on [instance registration](/app/concepts/instance_registration) to understand how they fit in that process.
- Check our guide on [how to create a registration key](/dashboard/guides/create_registration_key) to get started.
