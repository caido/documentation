# Workspace

Workspaces provide a central repository for various objects in the Caido ecosystem.
Each User and Team gets a `Default` Workspace.

It will eventually we possible to create more workspaces and assign access permissions to them.

At the moment a Workspace can contain:

- [Instances](/app/concepts/instance): An installation of Caido
- [Registration Keys](./registration_key.md): Keys to automatically claim instances
