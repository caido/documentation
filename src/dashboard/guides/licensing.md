# Licensing

In order for team members to access workspace instances, each member must claim a "seat" of your Team or Enterprise tier subscription.

## Billing

To upgrade your account subscription, click on the <code><Icon icon="fas fa-bolt" /> Upgrade</code> button in the `Active Plan` section of the `Home` tab interface.

::: info
Caido uses [Paddle](https://www.paddle.com/) for payment processing.
:::

Team tier accounts include a maximum of 50 seats. To select the number of seats for your team, click on the arrow buttons to increase or decrease the total seat count at checkout.

::: warning NOTE
If your organization needs additional seats, purchase orders, security questionnaires, custom terms, or custom integrations [contact sales](https://app.formbricks.com/s/cm8m73pnu0000jm03mw4wzejl) to obtain an Enterprise tier account.

## Assigning Seats

Once an account holds an active Team or Enterprise tier subscription, seats can be assigned to members with an <code><Icon icon="fas fa-check" /> Active</code> status by **clicking** the `Use seat` checkbox of a team member's row in the `Users` page.
