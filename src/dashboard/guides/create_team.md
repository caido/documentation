# Creating a Team

<ProContainer>
<b>Teams</b> are only available to Team and Enterprise tier subscriptions.
</ProContainer>

Teams allow you to invite members to a group to collaborate on instances associated with an account workspace. Access management, license distribution, and permission controls for teams are configured via the Caido Dashboard.

To permit workspace access, **click** on the `+ Create a Team` button in the <code><Icon icon="fas fa-home" /> Home</code> tab interface.

Name the team, enter the email address of the team owner that will act as the initial administrative user, and **click** on the <code><Icon icon="fas fa-arrow-right" /> Next</code> button.

## Inviting Team Members

Each team member can be assigned one of two roles:

- **Admin**: Grants full control over a team including its associated members, billing information, access tokens, and settings.
- **Member**: Grants control over team invitation revocation and licensing seat assignments.

To add a team member, enter their email address, select a permission level from the `Role` drop-down menu, and click on the `Add Member` button.

Once members have been added, **clicking** the <code><Icon icon="fas fa-arrow-right" /> Next</code> button allows you to review and confirm the team settings. To edit any details, **click** on the `Back` button.
