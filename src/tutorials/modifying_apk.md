::: warning NOTE
This tutorial is a continuation of [Android Setup and Configuration](/tutorials/android_configuration.md). Ensure your environment and device are prepared before continuing.
:::

::: info

- ****This process does not require a rooted device.****
- Be aware that the exact names and locations of setting options may vary between devices.
- Ensure to pay attention to any prompts on the device itself while proceeding through these steps.
- For convenience, add all installed tools to your system's `PATH` envrionment variable to make them globally accessible. Ensure to restart your terminal afterwards so the changes take effect.
- For physical devices, make sure the device is connected to the computer running Caido via USB and that both the device and the computer are on the same Wi-Fi network.

## Android Package Kits

Android applications are files bundled as `.apk` (**Android Package Kit**) packages and must be modified for use with Caido.

::: warning NOTE
In this tutorial, we’ll use the **HTTPToolkit Pinning Demo** application to demonstrate how to modify an APK so that Caido can proxy its traffic, and we’ll test these changes using the app’s various HTTP requests. If you are new to mobile application testing, we recommend you [download the HTTPToolkit SSL Pinning Demo APK](https://github.com/httptoolkit/android-ssl-pinning-demo/releases/download/v1.4.1/pinning-demo.apk) to ensure the steps align exactly.

Once downloaded, install the application to your connected device with:

```
adb install pinning-demo.apk
```

APKs can be acquired by downloading them directly from repositories or sites such as [apkmirror.com](https://www.apkmirror.com/) or [apkpure.com](https://apkpure.com/).

<details>
<summary>APKs can also be extracted from applications already installed on your device. Expand this section to learn how.</summary>

1. Initialize a command-line interface on your Android device:

```
adb shell
```

2. Find the application's `base.apk` package on your device by listing all the file paths of installed packages and filtering the results by the application name:

```
pm list packages -f | grep -i pinning
```

<img alt="Finding the base package." src="/_images/adb_package_location.png" center no-shadow/>

3. Copy the location and exit the device command-line interface using`CTRL+D` or by typing and entering `exit`.

4. Pull the `base.apk` from your device to your computer (_do not include the `=<package-name>` portion of the output_):

```
adb pull /data/app/tech.httptoolkit.pinning_demo-1wMoq8214ewjz2S-xt-sCA==/base.apk
```

<img alt="Pulling the base package." src="/_images/apk_pulled.png" center no-shadow/>

</details>

### Unpacking APKs

**Apktool** is a tool for reverse engineering Android applications. Once you have an application's APK, with Apktool you can decompile the package into its individual resources (_such as XML files, images, and code_) and then rebuild them after making modifications.

[Download Apktools for your operating system.](https://apktool.org/docs/install)

To unpack the contents of an APK to a new directory within the current directory, use the following command:

```
apktool d -o unpacked pinning-demo.apk
```

_If you extracted the APK, ensure to replace `pinning-demo.apk` with `base.apk`._

<img alt="Unpacking the APK." src="/_images/apk_unpacked.png" center no-shadow/>

## Modifying the Network Security Configuration File

One of the reasons that Caido may not be able to proxy the application traffic is due to the presence of a [Network Security Configuration file](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/security-config).
Introduced in Android 7.0 (API level 24), the `network_security_config.xml` file allows developers to customize network security settings for their applications.

In some cases, modifying this file and including the `<certificates src="user" overridePins="true" />` directive to trust user-supplied certificates may be enough to make the application Caido compatible.

To make the appropriate changes:

1. Open the `/res/xml/network_security_config.xml` file, or if it doesn't exist, create it.

2. Replace or write the content of the file to:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<network-security-config>
    <!-- Base configuration that applies to all connections if not overridden. -->
    <base-config>
        <!-- Define which certificates should be trusted as root CAs (trust anchors). -->
        <trust-anchors>
            <!-- Trust the pre-installed system certificates. -->
            <certificates src="system" />
            <!-- Trust user-installed certificates (like Caido's CA) and allow them to override certificate pinning. -->
            <certificates src="user" overridePins="true" />
        </trust-anchors>
    </base-config>
</network-security-config>
```

3. Ensure that the main configuration file, `AndroidManifest.xml` references the `network_security_config.xml` file via the `android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config"` attribute in the `<application>` tag. If you created a new `network_security_config.xml` file, you will have to explicitly add this.

4. From the directory of the unpacked APK, repack it with:

```
apktool b -o modified.apk ./
```

<img alt="Repacking the APK." src="/_images/apk_repack.png" center no-shadow/>

5. You will need the `keytool` and `jarsigner` tools in order to repack the APK. These tools are included in the Java Development Kit (JDK).

[Download the JDK for your operating system](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/23/install/overview-jdk-installation.html) and add it to your system's `PATH` environment variable.

6. Generate a signing key with:

```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore custom.keystore -alias aliasname -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

<img alt="Generating a key." src="/_images/apk_keytool_genkey.png" center no-shadow/>

7. Sign the APK with:

```
jarsigner -keystore custom.keystore -verbose modified.apk aliasname
```

<img alt="Signing the APK." src="/_images/apk_signed.png" center no-shadow/>

8. Uninstall the original application from the device:

```
adb uninstall tech.httptoolkit.pinning_demo
```

9. Install the modified APK:

```
adb install modified.apk
```

10. Navigate to your device settings and search for "certificates". Select `Install from phone storage` and select Caido's CA Certificate. Click `Done` to continue. Provide an arbitrary certificate name. This time select the `VPN and apps` option in the `Used for` dropdown menu. Click `OK` to save.

<img alt="Mobile app Caido certificate options." src="/_images/android_app_cert_option.png" center no-shadow width="300"/>

11. Next, open the HTTPToolkit application on your device. You should be able to make the following requests:

<img alt="Testing requests." src="/_images/pinning_demo_test.png" center no-shadow width="300"/>

11. You will now see traffic generated by the application in Caido's HTTP History.

<img alt="APK traffic." src="/_images/apk_test_traffic.png" center/>

As you can see, certain requests still result in an error message and are not proxied through Caido. This is due to additional security measures. If you are still unable to successfully proxy an application's traffic, certificate pinning may be implemented in the codebase itself.

## Frida

**Frida** is a toolkit that allows you to hook custom scripts into running Android application processes, enabling real-time analysis and modification. This is what we will use to modify the processes are checking the SSL/TLS certificates.

[Download Frida's CLI tools.](https://frida.re/docs/installation/)

### Frida Gadget

Since certain Frida operations may not work with unrooted devices, you will also need the **Frida Gadget** library. Once we inject the library into the APK, we can then send commands to it using the CLI tools.

You can check what download you will need for your device's architecture with:

```
adb shell getprop ro.product.cpu.abi
```

Then, choose the appropriate Frida Gadget library download:

- For `armeabi-v7a` or `armeabi`: [android-arm.so.xz](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/download/16.6.6/frida-gadget-16.6.6-android-arm.so.xz)
- For `arm64-v8a`: [android-arm64.so.xz](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/download/16.6.6/frida-gadget-16.6.6-android-arm64.so.xz)
- For `x86`: [android-x86.so.xz](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/download/16.6.6/frida-gadget-16.6.6-android-x86.so.xz)
- For `x86_64`: [android-x86_64.so.xz](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases/download/16.6.6/frida-gadget-16.6.6-android-x86_64.so.xz)

::: tip
The provided links will download v16.6.6. [View the latest releases in the Frida repository.](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases)
:::

Once downloaded, extract the library and rename it to:

```
libfrida-gadget.so
```

## Bypassing Hardcoded Certificate Pinning

To bypass hardcoded certificate pinning protections, we will need to insert the Frida Gadget library into the main "activity" stated in the `AndroidManifest.xml` configuration file. In Android development, an activity is the term used to refer to a specific page/screen of the application.

1. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file of the unpacked APK in a text editor:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" android:compileSdkVersion="33" android:compileSdkVersionCodename="13" package="tech.httptoolkit.pinning_demo" platformBuildVersionCode="33" platformBuildVersionName="13">
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
    <application android:allowBackup="true" android:appComponentFactory="androidx.core.app.CoreComponentFactory" android:extractNativeLibs="false" android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher" android:label="@string/app_name" android:networkSecurityConfig="@xml/network_security_config" android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_round" android:supportsRtl="true" android:theme="@style/Theme.MyApplication">
        <activity android:exported="true" android:name="tech.httptoolkit.pinning_demo.MainActivity">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

2. The `application` tag will contain an `android:extractNativeLibs` attribute. In order for the Frida Gadget library to function properly, this needs to be set to `"true"`:

```
android:extractNativeLibs="true"
```

3. Next, search for the `activity` tag with a nested `intent-filter` tag that contains:

``` xml
<action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN"/>
<category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER"/>
```

Within this `activity` tag will be a `android:name` attribute which stores the full name of the package that serves the main activity of the application upon launch:

```
tech.httptoolkit.pinning_demo.MainActivity
```

::: info
The packages can be recognized by their ending syntax of `<Keyword>Activity` (_e.g. `MainActivity`, `SplashActivity`, `WindowActivity`, `LauncherActivity`, etc._).
:::

4. Recursively search through the unpacked APK for the package name `tech.httptoolkit.pinning_demo.MainActivity` to locate its corresponding `.smali` file.

5. Open the `smali/tech/httptoolkit/pinning_demo/MainActivity.smali` file and locate the `.method public constructor <init>()V` initialization function:

``` smali
.method public constructor <init>()V
    .locals 0

    .line 51
    invoke-direct {p0}, Landroidx/appcompat/app/AppCompatActivity;-><init>()V

    return-void
.end method
```

6. Modify this function class definition to include the Frida Gadget script and increment the value of its `.locals` property to account for the change:

``` smali
.method public constructor <init>()V
    .locals 1

    const-string v0, "frida-gadget"
    invoke-static {v0}, Ljava/lang/System;->loadLibrary(Ljava/lang/String;)V

    .line 51
    invoke-direct {p0}, Landroidx/appcompat/app/AppCompatActivity;-><init>()V

    return-void
.end method
```

7. Next, create a `lib` directory in the unpacked APK folder, an architecture specific subdirectory, and move the `libfrida-gadget.so` file into it (_example: `/unpacked/lib/arm64-v8a/libfrida-gadget.so`_).

8. From the directory of the unpacked APK, repack it with:

```
apktool b -o unpinned.apk ./
```

<img alt="Repacking the APK." src="/_images/apk_unpinned_repack.png" center no-shadow/>

9. Sign the APK with:

```
jarsigner -keystore custom.keystore -verbose unpinned.apk aliasname
```

10. Uninstall the original application from the device:

```
adb uninstall tech.httptoolkit.pinning_demo
```

11. Install the modified APK:

```
adb install unpinned.apk
```

12. Next, open the SSL Pinning Demo application on your device. The screen will be blank as it is awaiting the script that will hook into the application's initialization. Supply it with:

```
frida -U gadget --codeshare fdciabdul/frida-multiple-bypass
```

14. Depending on the script used, you will now be able to make additional requests that were previously blocked when we only modified the `network_security_config.xml` file and see traffic in Caido's HTTP History.

### Bypass Scripts

Various HTTP libraries and their versions will require certain scripts in order to successfully bypass them.

#### Frida CodeShare

[Frida Codeshare](https://codeshare.frida.re/browse) is Frida's official repository of scripts that can be called using the `--codeshare` command-line argument.

```
frida -U gadget --codeshare <author>/<file>
```

::: danger WARNING
When sourcing files online, ensure to evaluate the code for any malicious operations before executing it.
:::

You can also write them yourself or source them alternative repositories. To specify a file, use the `-l` command-line argument followed by the file's location:

```
frida -U gadget -l <file>
```
