# Proxying Android Emulator Traffic

In this tutorial, we will cover the process of configuring an **Android Virtual Device (AVD)**, to proxy its traffic through Caido.

::: info

You will need to [download and install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for your operating system and [create an AVD](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds?utm_source=android-studio) using a system image that does not include Google Play.

## Android Studio

**Android Studio** is the official IDE for developing Android applications. It features the **Android Emulator** that can create a variety of AVDs at specified API levels.

[Download and install Android Studio for your operating system.](https://developer.android.com/studio)

The installation also includes the **Android SDK** which provides multiple packages of command-line tools, including:

- `adb`: The **Android Debug Bridge**, included in the Platform-Tools package, allows you to interface with the Android device using your computer's terminal.
- `emulator`: Included in **Emulator** package, this terminal command gives you control over an AVD.

You can view the location of the available SDK developer tools by selecting `SDK Manager` from the `More Actions` dropdown menu of the `Projects` interface.

In the window that appears, the `Android SDK Location` will contain the full file path to the packages.

Make both `adb` and `emulator` globally accessible by adding their directories to your system's `PATH` environment variable.

## System Images and Certificate Stores

Some applications may not trust user-installed certificates and instead refer to the pre-installed system certificates. To capture HTTPS traffic from these applications, we must inject the Caido CA certificate into the system store.

::: warning NOTE
System images that include Google Play in their build are signed with a release key and don't allow root access. In order to capture HTTPS traffic generated by an application with Caido, avoid selecting any Google Play builds when [creating an AVD](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds?utm_source=android-studio).

Additionally, if you want a user interface for the device, avoid selecting any ATD builds.

Instead, use images listed as:

- Google APIs
- Android Open Source Project (AOSP)
- Default Android System Image
- Base versions (_Android x.x.x ()_)

## Renaming Caido's CA Certificate

In order for Caido's CA Certificate to be compatible with the Android system, it will need to meet the expected naming format.

<img alt="List of connected Android devices." src="/_images/cert_name_format.png" center no-shadow/>

1. Generate the legacy hash of Caido's CA certificate's subject field:

```
openssl x509 -inform DER -subject_hash_old -in </path/to/your/ca.crt>
```

2. Rename the Caido CA certificate to the hash with a `.0` extension.

## Adding a System CA Certificate

1. List your available AVDs:

```
emulator -list-avds
```

2. Launch the desired AVD with write permissions:

```
emulator -avd <avd> -writable-system
```

3. In a new terminal, restart the `adbd` process on the emulator to gain root privileges:

```
adb root
```

<img alt="Restart ADB." src="/_images/adbd_root.png" center no-shadow/>

4. Disable secure boot verification:

```
adb shell avbctl disable-verification
```

<img alt="ADB disable verification." src="/_images/adb_disable_verification.png" center no-shadow/>

5. Reboot the device:

```
adb reboot
```

6. Restart the device with root permissions:

```
adb root
```

7. Remount the partitions as read-write:

```
adb remount
```

<img alt="ADB remount." src="/_images/adb_remount.png" center no-shadow/>

8. Push the renamed Caido certificate to the system store:

```
adb push </path/to/certificate> /system/etc/security/cacerts
```

<img alt="ADB push." src="/_images/adb_push_cert.png" center no-shadow/>

9. Set the proper permissions:

```
adb shell chmod 664 -v /system/etc/security/cacerts/<certificate>
```

10. Reboot the device:

```
adb reboot
```
