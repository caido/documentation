# Android Setup and Configuration

In this tutorial, we will cover how to setup and configure an Android device in order to proxy HTTP/HTTPS traffic generated by Android applications.

::: danger WARNING
Caido is not liable for any malfunctions, failures, damages, loss/theft of data, or other technical issues that may occur with your device as a result of following this tutorial. Proceed at your own risk.

::: info

- Be aware that the exact names and locations of setting options may vary between devices.
- Ensure to pay attention to any prompts on the device itself while proceeding through these steps.
- For convenience, add all installed tools to your system's `PATH` envrionment variable to make them globally accessible. Ensure to restart your terminal afterwards so the changes take effect.
- For physical devices, make sure the device is connected to the computer running Caido via USB and that both the device and the computer are on the same Wi-Fi network.

## Android SDK Platform-Tools: adb

To interface with the Android device using your computer's terminal, you will need the **Android Debug Bridge (adb)** which is included in the Platform-Tools package of the Android SDK.

[Download the Platform-Tools for your operating system.](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools#downloads) Once downloaded, unzip the folder.

To use `abd` with your Android device, navigate to the device settings and enable the [`Developer options`](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable). Then enable `USB debugging`.

If the device is connected, it will be listed in the output of the `adb devices` command.

## Configuring the Proxy Settings

To configure your Android device to use Caido:

1. Navigate to the device Wi-Fi settings and select your network SSID.
2. Access the `Advanced` settings of the network and select the `Manual` option from the `Proxy` dropdown menu:
3. Set the proxy address to: `127.0.0.1:8080`

5. Click `Save` to set the proxy configurations.

### Port Forwarding

Since Caido is running on your computer, not your phone - run the following command to forward traffic from `localhost:8080` on your device to port `8080` on your computer through the USB connection:

```
adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080
```

## What's next?

In order for [Caido to proxy the HTTPS traffic](/concepts/essentials/https_traffic.md) an application generates, you must bypass any implementations of **certificate pinning**. This security technique configures an application to only trust system-store or explicitly defined CA certificates. This becomes an issue since we want the application to trust the Caido's CA certificate in order to inspect, modify, and forward the traffic it generates.

Clients maintain two certificate stores:

1. System-store certificates: Pre-installed trusted Root and Intermediary CA certificates.
2. User-store certificates: Added by the end user.

In order to bypass this security mechanism:

[You will need to add Caido's CA certificate to the system-store with root level permissions.](/tutorials/add_certificate.md)

[You will need to unpack the APK, make modifications, and repack it back into a functioning application.](/tutorials/modifying_apk.md)
