## What data do you collect?

When you register for Caido, we collect your name and email address, as well as information about your user agent.

## Where can I ask for support and/or feature requests?

You can ask for support and submit feature requests through our public <a href="https://links.caido.io/www-discord" target="_blank">Discord</a> or <a href="https://links.caido.io/www-github-issues" target="_blank">Github repository</a>. Both are great places to share feedback and help improve Caido.

## How do I gain access to the dedicated Discord support channels?

Caido Individual and Team level subscriptions come with prioritized customer support. To access these channels, you must first [link your Discord account](/guides/discord.md).

## What is the difference between Caido CLI and Caido Desktop?

The Caido CLI is self-contained binary that launches the Caido proxy (also called instance). You can use it on remote servers or locally and access the instance using your browser. The Caido Desktop acts a connection manager to your instances and can also launch the Caido proxy in the background. It uses webviews to access the instance instead of the browser.
