## What is the difference between Caido CLI and Caido Desktop?

The Caido CLI is self-contained binary that launches the Caido proxy (also called instance). You can use it on remote servers or locally and access the instance using your browser. The Caido Desktop acts a connection manager to your instances and can also launch the Caido proxy in the background. It uses webviews to access the instance instead of the browser.
