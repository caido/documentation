## What is the difference between Caido CLI and Caido Desktop

The Caido CLI is self-contained binary that launches the Caido proxy (also called instance). You can use it on remote servers or locally and access the instance using your browser. The Caido Desktop acts a connection manager to your instances and can also launch the Caido proxy in the background. It uses webviews to access the instance instead of the browser.

> **WARNING**: At the moment, Caido Desktop is considered experimental and does not perform as well as the browser on Linux.

## I've encountered an error, what do I do?

There is 3 options available:

- Go check out the [Common errors](./common_errors.md) page
