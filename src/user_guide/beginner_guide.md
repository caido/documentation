# Beginner Guide: _Onboarding New Users_

Welcome! Thank you for choosing Caido!

## The HyperText Transfer Protocol:

The HyperText Transfer Protocol consists of a **client** and
**_server_** model. For the average person browsing the web, the
**_client_** in this relationship is the browser they are using (_such as Firefox, Safari, Chrome, etc._). While the **_server_** is the device that the browser is communicating back and forth with.

In this model, a client will send **requests** and the server will reply with **responses**.

**Requests** are made to ask for **_resources_**. **Resources** in this context are anything that constructs the website you view in your browser.

Items such as an HTML file (_this file defines the layout of all the different elements that are included in the web page_), a CSS file (_this file provides graphic design aspects to the elements of the file_), JavaScript files (_these code files are responsible for making the web page interactive_), image files, video files, etc. are all considered resources!

**Responses** are what the **_server_**

## What is Caido?
