# Import the CA certificate in your browser

To use Caido to intercept (and tamper with) your https traffic, it is necessary to import and trust the CA certificate of Caido in your browser. 

## Log in to Caido

After starting Caido on your machine, navigate to `localhost:8080` (or the port you've configured for Caido to listen to) and log in. 

## Get the Certificate

Open the "User Dropdown Menu" in the top right

Navigate to "CA Certificate" or click  [here](http://localhost:8080/#/settings/certificate). 

Download the Certificate and follow the instructions to import and trust it in your browser of choice.

After you've successfully imported the certificate, you are good to go and can configure your browser to proxy it's traffic through Caido.
