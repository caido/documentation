# Saving Projects

<ProContainer>
<b>Backups</b> are only available to users with Individual or Team tier subscriptions. However, all plans can restore backups.

Backups save all of a project's data as a self-contained file.

## Creating Backups

To create a backup file, **right-click** on a project's row or **click** on the `...` button and select `âŠŸ Create backup` from the context menu.

Messages will appear notifying you that the operation has been started. A subsequent message will appear once the backup has been created.
