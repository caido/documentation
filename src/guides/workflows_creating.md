# Creating Workflows

::: tip
View the Tutorials section of the documentation for detailed walk-throughs on creating a variety of workflows.
:::

To create a new workflow, select a [workflow type](/concepts/workflows_intro.md) by **clicking** on either the `Passive`, `Active`, or `Convert` tabs and **click** the `+ New workflow` button.

Once the workflow is created, you can edit its display name and provide an optional description.

In the workflow editor, **click**, **hold** and **drag** a node to rearrange its position. Once the nodes are arranged, **click** and **hold** on a node's <code><Icon icon="fas fa-caret-right" /></code> output socket and **drag** the line to the next node's <code><Icon icon="fas fa-caret-right" /></code> input socket to create connections.

::: tip
To open the editor in a larger window, **click** on the <code><Icon icon="fa-solid fa-up-right-and-down-left-from-center" /></code> button.

::: info
A node's `Alias` is a unique identifier used to reference it within a workflow. Aliases can only contain the following characters:

- Lowercase letters: `a`-`z`
- Numbers: `0`-`9`
- Symbols: `-`, `_`
:::

Once you are done creating the workflow, **click** on the <code><Icon icon="fas fa-floppy-disk" /> Save</code> button. A message will appear notifying you that the operation was successful and the new workflow will be added to its associated type list.

Workflows are enabled by default, to disable a workflow **click** on it's sliding radio button.

::: info
By default, workflows are globally available across all your projects. **Click** on `( Switch to project-specific )` within a workflow row to limit its scope.
