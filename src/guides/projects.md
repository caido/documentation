# Projects

Caido utilizes a client-server architecture model. An [instance](/concepts/essentials/instances.md) of Caido is essentially an installation.

Think of "projects" as separate directories for your audits. Projects allow you to stay organized when testing against multiple targets within the same Caido instance.

## Creating a New Project

1. Select the `Workspace` tab from the left-hand menu within the Caido window.
2. Ensure the `Projects` tab in the top-left area of the Caido window is selected.
3. Click on the red `+ Create a project` button in the top-right area of the Caido window. Name the project - consider using a descriptive name of the context the project will be utilized for (_such as the name of the client you are auditing, a specific bug bounty program, the name of the product, etc._). Once you have entered a name - click on the `Create` button.
4. Your new project will now appear in the `Workspace` panel.
5. Clicking on `â‹®` will present the following additional options:

- **Rename**: Rename your project.
- **Copy path**: Copy the project's data location on your device to your clipboard.
- **Create backup**: Create a Backup of the project data.
- **Delete**: Delete the project from your instance.

## Switching Between Projects

Caido offers the ability to switch between your projects with ease. Switching projects can be accomplished in two different ways:

1. Selecting the `Workspace` tab from the left-hand menu within the Caido window and clicking the `Select` button next to the desired project.
2. Selecting the desired project in the drop-down menu, located in the upper-right corner of the Caido window.

::: tip TIPS

- It is encouraged to keep your work organized by creating many smaller projects.
- **No restart is required in order to switch project.** You can navigate different assessments quickly without losing track of the information you've collected.

## Restoring a Project from a Backup

To restore your projects from a Backup, click the `Restore` button within the Backups interface or use the `Import` button near the search bar within the Projects interface and provide a path to a `.caidobak` file.

## Project Updating

When structural changes occur after a Caido update, sometimes it is necessary for Caido to update a project to a new format. This can take time but will ensure you're working with the latest capabilities in Caido.

::: info
Projects are automatically upgraded when you use them with a newer Caido version and **CANNOT** be downgraded.
