# Proxying Local Traffic

To proxy local traffic, it is necessary to bypass implicit rules that match against localhost addresses using a method mentioned below.

## FoxyProxy

**Click** on the FoxyProxy browser extension, select `Options`, type `<-loopback>` to the `Global Exclude` input field, and **click** on the `Save` button to update and save the configuration.

::: info
In general, the implicit bypass rules can be modified in the proxy settings of different systems/browsers/extensions by supplying `<-loopback>` to the hosts list. This input field is typically accompanied with a title or description that includes terms or keywords such as: `except these addresses`/`no-proxy for`/`exclude`.
:::

## Chrome

Launch Chrome via the terminal with the `--proxy-server=<address:port>` and `--proxy-bypass-list="<-loopback>"` arguments.

```
google-chrome --proxy-server=127.0.0.1:8080` --proxy-bypass-list="<-loopback>"
```

## Firefox

Launch Firefox, navigate to `about:config`, set `network.proxy.allow_hijacking_localhost` to `true`, and restart the browser.
