# HTTP History

The `HTTP History` interface allows you to view requests and responses as they pass through the proxy. The HTTP History interface shows a table of all requests that have been proxied through Caido.

The table format allows for easy examination of the traffic flow by offering categories of sortable properties. These properties include details such as the intended host of the request, the request method used, pathing and extension information - as well as details of the associated response such as status code, response length and response time.

Advanced filtering and data exportation capabilities are also integrated into the HTTP History interface.

::: tip
Requests generated by Workflows, Plugins, Replay, and Automate can be viewed in the [Search](/guides/search.md) interface table.

## Modifications of Requests/Responses

**If you previously edited content directly in the Intercept interface:**

In the `HTTP History` and `Search` tabs, a dropdown menu will appear in any requests or responses that you modified within Intercept before forwarding. The `Manual` selection will display the edits while the `Original` selection will show the request/response in its initial state.

::: info
This includes any modifications made by any active [Match & Replace](/guides/match_replace.md) rule(s).
