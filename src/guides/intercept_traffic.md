To give you control over what traffic is intercepted, Caido provides buttons for HTTP requests, HTTP responses, and Websocket messages.

To intercept traffic of a specific type, **click** on its associated button to toggle it to the `⏸︎` state.

When interception is enabled, Caido will list all of the awaiting traffic in a queue table. Select any queued HTTP request, HTTP response, or Websocket message from its associated table to view its contents.

Once traffic has been intercepted, there are various actions that can be taken against it.
