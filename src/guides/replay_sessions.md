# Managing Sessions

Everytime a request is sent in Replay it is tracked as a `Session`, providing you with a historical record of its state.

## Viewing the Requests in a Session

The number of times a request has been sent is displayed at the bottom of its pane.

## Reverting Through Requests in a Session

By clicking on the `<` or `>` buttons, you can navigate through a Session to view how modifications to a request have altered its associated response.

## Creating a New Session

Clicking on the `+ New Session` button will generate a new request tab, allowing you to manually create a request. Entering a URL within the input field above a request pane will generate a minimal request.
