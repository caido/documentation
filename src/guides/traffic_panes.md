# Interfacing with HTTP Traffic Panes

By **clicking** on an HTTP traffic table row, its associated request and corresponding response will each be displayed in their own panes.

## Viewing Body Data

HTTP request and response data can be viewed in two different formats:

- `Pretty`: Formats the data with whitespaces, indentation, and new lines for enhanced readability.
- `Raw`: Represents the data exactly as it was transmitted.

To switch between the two views, **click** on their associated buttons.

## Previewing Responses

You can also preview responses directly within HTTP response panes just as they would appear in your browser window.

To make use of this feature, **click** on the `ðŸ‘¤` button in the top-right corner of the Caido user-interface, select `Settings`, and open the `Rendering` tab. Then, **click** on the `Install now` button to install the required rendering engine.

Once the rendering engine is installed, you can click on the `Preview` or `ðŸ—‹` button attached to a response pane to render the view.
