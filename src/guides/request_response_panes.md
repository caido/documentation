# Working with Requests & Responses

HTTP requests and their corresponding responses will be presented in side-by-side panes.

While certain request and response panes are intended to be view-only, others are editors.

The data can be viewed in two different formats:

- `Pretty`: Formats the data with whitespaces, indentation, and new lines for enhanced readability.
- `Raw`: Represents the data exactly as it was transmitted.

To switch between the two views, **click** on their associated buttons.
