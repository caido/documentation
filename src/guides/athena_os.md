[Athena OS](https://athenaos.org/) is an Arch-derived Linux distribution designed for penetration testing and security research. Athena's [cybersecurity role-based system](https://athenaos.org/en/resources/athena-welcome/#cyber-security-roles) equips you with the relevant tools needed to conduct comprehensive security assessments, making it an exceptional choice for security professionals.

Additionally, with Athena's ability to connect directly to educational platforms, it's an ideal operating system for information security students.
