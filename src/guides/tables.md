# Customizing Tables

Throughout Caido, you will encounter various tables.

## Sorting Rows

To determine which table columns you can sort rows by, hover your cursor over the column names. If your cursor becomes a hand icon, you can toggle the listing order of a table by clicking a column's name.

## Filtering

In certain tables, you can include/exclude columns by clicking on the gear icon button in the lower right-hand corner.
