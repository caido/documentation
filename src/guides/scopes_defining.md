# Defining a Scope

Scopes are defined by creating sets of target lists referred to as "scope presets".

- Targets added to the `In Scope` list will be <span style="color: #DAA520;">included</span> in traffic tables and operations.

- Targets added to the `Out of Scope` list will be <span style="color: #C8285B;">excluded</span> in traffic tables and operations.

The targets in either list will be compared against the value of the `Host` header or destination IP address of proxied requests.

::: info
Scope presets are specific to the project they are created in.
:::

::: tip
Paths are not supported in scope presets but can be included or excluded from traffic tables with filter presets.

## Creating a New Scope Preset Manually

To create a new scope presets, **click** on the `+ New Preset` button and press `ENTER`.

Once the scope preset is created, you can edit its display name by typing within the `Name *` input field. To save the new name, press `ENTER`.

### Defining Targets

To define targets, **click** in either the `In Scope` input field or `Out of Scope` input field and type in either IP addresses or domains, each on a new line.

::: info
Domains can only contain the following characters:

- Lowercase letters: `a`-`z`
- Numbers: `0`-`9`
- Symbols: `.`, `-`, `_`, `*`, `?`
:::

::: tip
The `*` and `?` characters in a target domain act as wildcard characters that can be used to account for subdomains and top-level domains:

- `*`: Matches multiple characters.
- `?`: Matches a single character.

For example, to account for all subdomains of `example.com`, add `*.example.com` to a list.

:::

Once you have defined the target lists, **click** on the <code><Icon icon="fas fa-floppy-disk" /> Save</code> button to update and save the scope preset.

## Creating a New Scope from the Context Menu

To quickly create a new scope preset and add a request's target domain to be either in-scope or out-of-scope, **right-click** within a request pane to open the context menu, hover your mouse cursor over `Add in Scope` or `Add out of Scope`, and select `+ Create New Scope`.

A message will appear notifying you that the operation was successful.

You can view the generated scope preset by navigating to the Scopes interface. It will be automatically named with the target domain.
