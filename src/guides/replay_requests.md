# Sending Requests to Replay

You can send requests from other interfaces to the Replay interface in various ways:

- By **right-clicking** on a request row in a traffic table or within a request pane, hovering your mouse cursor over `Send to Replay`, and selecting the Collection to include it in.

- Or by selecting a request row or focusing a request pane and using the default keyboard shortcut `CTRL+R`.

Requests in the Replay interface are referred to as "sessions". Each session is listed as a tab that stores the associated request.
