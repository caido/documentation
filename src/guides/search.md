# Search

The `Search` interface provides a comprehensive view of all the requests that have been generated by Caido, including requests from workflows, plugins, Replay, and Automate, in addition to requests that are proxied through Caido via Intercept.

Search differs from other tables in Caido in that way - as the other tabs do not list any request generated by Automate and Replay.

This extra inclusion allows you to sort through the results of all your testing using other Caido features in a single location.

An HTTPQL query search bar is only available within Search for Caido Pro users.

## Filtering

Additional default Filter Presets in the `Advanced options` panel are included to display/exclude traffic generated by Replay and Automate. Within this panel are also options to filter by the following:

- The source of the requests (implicit OR).
- The status code of the responses (implicit OR).
- The presets to use (implicit AND).

::: info
There is an implicit AND in-between each of those sections.

::: tip TIPS

- Clicking the `{}` button will toggle the Pretty/Raw display option.
- If you have installed the rendering engine - clicking the image icon located at the top-right corner of the response pane will present a visual representation of the response.
