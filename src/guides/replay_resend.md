# Resending Requests

You can send requests from other interfaces to the `Replay` interface in various ways:

- By right-clicking on a request row in a traffic table or within a request pane, hovering your mouse cursor over `Send to Replay`, and selecting the Collection to include it in.

- Or by selecting a request row or focusing a request pane and using the keyboard shortcut `CTRL+R`.

Once a request has been sent to Replay, it will be contained in a tab and available in a request pane. Clicking within a request pane will allow you to make modifications.

To resend a request, simply click on the `Send` button.
