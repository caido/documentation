# Deleting Data in Caido

::: danger
We do not recommend modifying the files directly as this might result in problems in the application and/or corruption of data. Proceed at your own risk.
:::

Caido does not currently support a CLI argument or desktop application functionality for deleting data. However, although it is not recommended, data can be deleted manually using the SQLite CLI.

::: tip
View the [internal files](/reference/internal_files.md) reference to learn about the file system structure.

## Finding a Project

1. Decide which project you want to clean.
2. Navigate to your Caido data path.
3. Open the projects database using `sqlite3 projects.db`.
4. Run `select * from projects;` and keep the UUID of the project you want to modify.

`08c09bfa-a9fd-41e5-909e-2338a28319f9`

## Preparing the Project Database

1. If Caido is running, kill the application.
2. Navigate to `projects/<project-uuid>/`.
3. Open the main data: `sqlite3 database.caido`
4. Switch to WAL mode: `PRAGMA main.journal_mode = WAL;`
5. Attach the raw database: `ATTACH DATABASE 'database_raw.caido' AS raw;`
6. Switch to WAL mode: `PRAGMA raw.journal_mode = WAL;`
7. Enable foreign keys: `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;`

Do NOT skip the foreign keys step!

## Deleting Requests

::: danger
As traffic is stored in multiple tables, to avoid data corruption, ensure to follow the order of operations below.
:::

### Determining Requests & Responses to Delete

The first step is to find a list of requests we want to delete. We will keep that in a temporary table.

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE requests_to_delete AS
SELECT id, response_id, raw_id
FROM requests
WHERE <your_condition_here> -- Replace with your condition.
```

For example, the condition could be: `host = "www.youtube.com"`.

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE responses_to_delete AS
WITH RECURSIVE recursive_responses AS (
    SELECT r.id, r.parent_id, r.raw_id
    FROM responses r
    INNER JOIN requests_to_delete rd ON r.id = rd.response_id
    UNION ALL
    SELECT r.id, r.parent_id, r.raw_id
    FROM responses r
    INNER JOIN recursive_responses rr ON r.parent_id = rr.id
 )
SELECT id FROM recursive_responses;
```

### Cleaning Requests Raw

```sql
DELETE FROM requests_raw
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT raw_id
  FROM requests_to_delete
);
```

### Cleaning Responses Raw

```sql
DELETE FROM responses_raw
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT raw_id
  FROM responses_to_delete
);
```

### Cleaning Sitemap Entries

```sql
DELETE FROM sitemap_entries
WHERE request_id IN (
  SELECT id
  FROM requests_to_delete
);
```

### Cleaning Requests

This will also clean `scoped_requests` and `requests_metadata`.

```sql
DELETE FROM requests
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id
  FROM requests_to_delete
);
```

### Cleaning Responses

```sql
DELETE FROM responses
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id
  FROM responses_to_delete
);
```
