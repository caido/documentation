# Changing Request & Response View Modes

HTTP request and response data can be viewed in two different formats:

- `Pretty`: Formats the data with whitespaces, indentation, and new lines for enhanced readability.
- `Raw`: Represents the data exactly as it was transmitted.

To switch between the two views, **click** on their associated buttons.
