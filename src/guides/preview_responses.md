# Previewing Responses

You can preview responses directly within HTTP response panes just as they would appear in your browser window.

To make use of this feature, **click** on the `ðŸ‘¤` button in the top-right corner of the Caido user-interface, select `Settings`, and open the `Rendering` tab. Then, **click** on the `Install now` button to install the required rendering engine.

Once the rendering engine is installed, you can click on the `Preview` or `ðŸ—‹` button attached to a response pane to render the view.
