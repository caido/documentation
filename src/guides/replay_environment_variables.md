# Using Environment Variables in Replay

When testing targets using `Replay`, you can easily switch context by leveraging your custom environments and associated variables.

## Creating Environment Variables

To create a new environment and define its variables, navigate to the `Environment` interface in Caido.

Then, depending on if the environment is new or existing, click on either the `Create` or `Update` button in the bottom left corner of the pane.

## Inserting an Environment Variable

With a defined environment variable, navigate to the [Replay](/guides/replay.md) interface. Within a request editing pane, **click**, **hold**, and **drag** the left mouse button over the value you want to be replaced and then click the `+` button to add it as a placeholder.

Next, click on the associated `ðŸ–‰` button of the placeholder. Doing so will present the `Placeholder Settings` window.

With `Environment Variable` as the `Type`, click on the `Select an environment variable` drop-down menu, select a environment variable from the list, and click `Add` to save the configuration.

Applied environment variables will be listed in the window table. If multiple environment variables are listed, they will overwrite in top to bottom order.

To change the order, **left-click**, **drag**, and **hold** a row either above or below other rows in the table and **release**.

Close the settings window and send the request. To verify the addition was successful, you can view the request by navigating to the [Search](/guides/search.md) interface.
