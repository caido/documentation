# Managing Scopes

Once a Scope Preset is created, there are various actions that can be taken against it.

## Adding to Target Lists

To add targets to an existing Scope Preset, you can either:

- Select the Scope Preset from the Scopes interface, manually type targets into either the `In Scope` or `Out of Scope` lists, and apply the updates by **clicking** the <code><Icon icon="fas fa-floppy-disk" /> Save</code> button.

- Or you can add a request's target domain to the Scope Preset by **right-clicking** on a request pane, hovering your mouse cursor over `Add in Scope` or `Add out of Scope`, and selecting the Scope Preset by its name. A message will appear notifying you that the operation was successful.
