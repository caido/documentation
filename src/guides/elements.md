# Managing Elements

As you use Caido, the user-interface will populate with elements that reflect your activity. The majority of these elements come with various controls, available as buttons or menu options, that are designed to give you fine-grained control over your workspace.

## Context Menu Options

**Right-clicking** on certain elements in the Caido user-interface will open a context menu with various actions and options to select from.

## Buttons

As Caido is designed with ease-of-use in mind, all buttons are intuitive or labeled. If a button is not visibly labeled, hover your mouse cursor over it to reveal its label.
