# Distributions

Caido is included natively in a couple OS distributions. If you already use one of them, it is the easiest way to get started! :sparkles:

Though, this is by no means a requirement since you can also [install Caido on all major operating systems](/guides/).

## Linux

- [Parrot Security](/guides/distributions/parrot_os): A Debian-based distribution that uses the MATE desktop environment, focused on security and privacy.
- [Athena OS](/guides/distributions/athena_os): An Arch & NixOS based pentesting distribution.

## You are a maintainer?

If you are a maintainer of distribution and would like to include Caido natively, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://links.caido.io/www-discord) or via [our contact form](https://caido.io/contact).
