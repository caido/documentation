# Distributions

Caido is included natively in a couple OS distributions. If you already use one of them, it is the easiest way to get started :sparkles:

This is by no mean a requirement since you can [install Caido on all major OS](/quickstart/beginner_guide/setup/install).

## Linux

- [Athena OS](/guides/distributions/athena_os): Arch & NixOS based pentesting distribution

## You are a maintainer?

If you are a maintainer of distribution and would like to include Caido natively, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://links.caido.io/www-discord) or via [our contact form](https://caido.io/contact).
