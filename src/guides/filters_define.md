# Defining a Filter

Filters are defined by creating sets of HTTPQL expressions referred to as `Filter Presets`.

::: info
Filter Presets are specific to the Project they are created in.

Once the Filter Preset is created, you can edit its display name and code alias by typing within the `Name *` and `Alias` input fields. Names and aliases must be unique across all Filter Presets for referencing purposes. To save the changes, press `ENTER`.

::: info
Aliases can only contain the following characters:

- Lowercase letters: `a`-`z`
- Numbers: `0`-`9`
- Symbols: `-`, `_`

### Defining Filters

To define filters, **click** in the `Expression` input field to type your HTTPQL expression.

::: tip
[View the HTTQL Reference documentation to learn expression syntax.](/reference/httpql.md)
:::

::: info
Filter Presets do not support the `preset` HTTPQL namespace.

Once you have defined the filter, **click** on the `ðŸ–« Save` button to update and save the Filter Preset.
