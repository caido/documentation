# Using Workflows in Replay

To apply a workflow to a value in a Replay request, **click**, **hold**, and **drag** over the value you want to replace and **click** the `+` button to add it as a placeholder. Then, **click** on the associated edit button <code><Icon icon="fas fa-pen-to-square" /></code> of the placeholder to open the `Placeholder Settings` window.

With `Workflow` as the `Type`, **click** on the `Select a workflow` drop-down menu, select a workflow from the list, and **click** `Add` to save the configuration.

Applied workflows are listed and will be applied in top to bottom order. To avoid collisions between workflows, you can rearrange their order by **left-clicking**, **dragging**, **holding**, and **releasing** a workflow either above or below other workflows in the list.

Close the settings window and send the request. To verify the application was successful, you can view the request by navigating to the Search interface.
