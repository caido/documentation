# Using Workflows in Replay

To apply a Workflow to a value in a Replay request, **click** on the associated `ðŸ–‰` button of the placeholder. Doing so will present the `Placeholder Settings` window.

With `Workflow` as the `Type`, **click** on the `Select a workflow` drop-down menu, select a Workflow from the list, and **click** `Add` to save the configuration.

Applied Workflows will be listed in the window table. If multiple Workflows are applied, they will execute in top to bottom order.

To change the order, **click**, **drag**, and **hold** a row either above or below other rows in the table and **release**.

Close the settings window and send the request. To verify the application was successful, you can view the request by navigating to the [Search](/guides/search.md) interface.
