# Using Workflows in Replay

To apply a Workflow to a value in a Replay request, click on the associated `ðŸ–‰` button of the placeholder.

With `Workflow` as the `Type`, click on the `Select a workflow` drop-down menu, select a Workflow from the list, and click `Add` to save the configuration.

Applied Workflows will be listed in the window table. If multiple Workflows are applied, they will execute in top to bottom order.

To change the order, **left-click**, **drag**, and **hold** a Workflow row either above or below other rows in the table.
