# Customizing the User Interface

Caido offers a high-degree of customization, so you can adjust the user-interface to suit your preferences and needs.

## Resizing Panes

To customize the layout of an interface, hover your mouse cursor between two panes until it is replaced with the grip icon <code><Icon icon="fas fa-arrow-left" /><Icon icon="fas fa-grip-lines-vertical" /><Icon icon="fas fa-arrow-right" /></code> or its vertical equivalent. Then, **left-click**, **hold**, and **drag** the gutter to resize a pane according to your preferences.

## Adjusting the Font Size

Caido allows you to adjust the font size of text within the user-interface and editors separately by providing two horizontal sliders. To access the font size settings, **click** on the account button <code><Icon icon="fas fa-user" /></code> in the top-right corner of the Caido user-interface, select `Settings`, and open the `Appearance` tab.

## Custom JavaScript and CSS

For advanced customization, Caido offers two coding environments in the `Settings` interface. To apply your own CSS rules to the user-interface, open the `Custom CSS` tab. To apply custom JavaScript to the user-interface, open the `Custom JavaScript` tab.
