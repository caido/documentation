# Sending Requests to Automate

You can send requests from other interfaces to the Automate interface in various ways:

- By **right-clicking** on a request row in a traffic table or within a request pane and **clicking** `Send to Automate`.

- Or by selecting a request row or focusing a request pane and using the default keyboard shortcut `CTRL+M`.

Requests in the Automate interface are referred to as "sessions". Each session is listed as a tab that stores the associated request.
