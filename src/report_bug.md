# Reporting a bug

Found a bug in Caido or need help debugging? You are at the right place!

> We need a few items to be able to reproduce bugs and help you ðŸ™‚

## 1. Backend Logs

Caido is using a [client/server architecture](/internals/instances.md), that means that we need logs from two place.

The first place to look for logs is in your [data folder](/configuration/data_location.md), you should see a `logs` folder.

## 2. Frontend Logs

The second place to loof for logs is in your browser console included in your [browser developer tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools).

You can open the console by pressing `F12` or doing a right-click `Inspect Element`.
