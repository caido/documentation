# Reporting a Bug

Found a bug in Caido or need help debugging? You are at the right place!

::: tip
We need a few items in order to be able to reproduce bugs and help you.
:::

## 1. Backend Logs

Caido is using a [client/server architecture](/concepts/essentials/instances.md), that means that we need logs from two places.

The first place to look for logs is in your [data folder](/guides/data_location.md), you should see a `logs` folder.

## 2. Frontend Logs

The second place to look for logs is in your browser's console included in your [browser developer tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools).

You can open the console by pressing `F12` or right-clicking within the browser and selecting `Inspect Element`.

## 3. Steps to Reproduce

For us to be able to help you, we need to be able to reproduce the bug on our side.

Thus, it is **critical** that you give us **as much details as possible** on the various steps you took leading to the bug.

::: tip
A good example of steps would be:

1. In `Intercept`, click on `Response`.
2. Start `Queuing`.
3. In a terminal, execute `curl -x 127.0.0.1:8080 https://example.com`.
4. Modify response status code.
5. Click `Forward`.
6. Confirm in terminal that the response was not modified.

## 4. Operating System & Version

Many Caido bugs are depend on the OS and even sometimes the version of that OS.
