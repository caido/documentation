## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

Welcome to the Caido documentation repository!

To contribute to our documentation, please see the contribution section below.

Please note that you'll also have to sign a [contributor license agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/caido/documentation) when submitting a PR.

Thanks in advance for your contributions!

## ðŸ”§ Contribution

We've taken the time to set up Codespaces on this repo, which makes setting up a local copy of [the documentation site](https://docs.caido.com), viewing your changes live, and creating a pull request back to the `main` branch SUPER easy. **The entire process will take less than 5 clicks and less than 5 minutes.**

An overview of the process is as follows:

1. Create a fork of the repository
1. Create a new branch
1. Create a `codespace` on this branch (the `codespace` settings will configure everything for you)
1. Make changes and view your changes on the local version of the documentation site found in the `ports` section of the VS Code interface
1. Commit changes to the branch using the VS Code interface
1. Create a pull request to main via VS Code interface or normal GitHub interface

Here is a link to our [style guide (WIP)](style-guide.md).

> Accounts get 60 hours per month of `codespace` run-time before you start getting charged; so don't forget to stop/delete your codespace after you've made your modification!
